    <i>Note that any lines referring to SFN 204 are not actually required as 204 filtering is performed within the WHERE clause of the UPDATE statement.  They have been included here so that the case statement may be substituted directly in a query and used to verify that the accounts are being classified correctly.  Without these statements, SFN 204s are incorrectly classified as either SFN 219s or 318s.</i>
