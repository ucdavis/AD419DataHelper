        *Note that any lines referring to SFN 204 are not actually required as 204 filtering is performed within the WHERE clause of the UPDATE statement.<br />
        They have been included here so that the case statement may be substituted directly in a query such as<br />
        "SELECT DISTINCT CHART, ACCOUNT, case_statement AS SFN<br />
        FROM AD419.dbo.NewAccountSFN<br />
        GROUP BY CHART, ACCOUNT, case_statement<br />
        ORDER BY CHART, ACCOUNT, SFN", and used to verify that the accounts are being classified correctly.<br />
        Without these statements, SFN 204s are incorrectly being displayed as classified SFN 219 or 318.
