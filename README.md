## AD419 Data Helper

Application for guiding users through setting up the annual AD419 reporting system, including importing data from external sources, verifying and editing edge case data, and computing financial records against campus datamarts.

Once this entire process is completed and the data has been given the OK, it is loaded in the correct tables for use in the existing AD419 application (https://github.com/ucdavis/AD419)
